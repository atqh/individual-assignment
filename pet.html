            <h2>Bawang</h2>
            <p>The title seems funny right?. This is my cat he is a male cat., I named it Awang. 
<br> Then why does the title is Bawang?  There is a story behind it
<br> when he was a little kitten my sister took care of him. she is weird because
<br> he had a bloated stomach so, my sister thought that he is sick. 
<br> But she finds out that he is actually fat. So my sister calls him Bawang because of 
<br> Awang+Bulat= Bawang. Bawang is so kind toward other cats 
<br> and he loves to ride a car. Last year he is missing without any sign, 
<br> I try to find him but he never came back. we keep a lot of memories together</p>
