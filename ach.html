    <h1>First Place</h1>
     <p> In 2016, I involved in one competition named Soutul Ummah organized by the scjool. 
      <br> this competition involved 10 participants from form 1 until form 5. 
      <br> I join this competition with my friends and we became duet. in this competition we need to prepare
      <br>a script to talk on the stage. The organizer will give us a rendom topic to be discuss every weekend
      <br> after a few week we strugle to give our best performance to the audience. Finally we got the first place in this competition
      <br> This is my best achievement because i tarin myself to become more confident in front of other people.

    <h1>This is my first time</h1>
     <p> in 2017, my teacher choose ask me to join a "forum perdana" represents our school 
     <br> to the state level at that moment i don't think that i'm good in forum so 
     <br> I decided to ask my parent first. Suprisingly they give me a moral support to join the competition
     <br> I was so nervousbut i try my best and my team got the third place. i still proud to myself because this is my first time involved in forum

    <h1>Indelib</h1>
     <p> one of the competition that i involved in University is Indelib. I joined this competition 2 time 
     <br> first in 2018 and second in 2019. I think thia is the best achievement because i never know that 
     <br>i can work with my team and create something useful for the library. I think this is the best memory
      <br> of my life that I never forget.</p>
